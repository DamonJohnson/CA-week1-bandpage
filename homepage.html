                 <p>Huey Lewis and the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. 
                They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s,
                eventually achieving 19 top ten singles across the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and Mainstream Rock charts.</p>
                <p>Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. 
                But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. 
                The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, 
                and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. 
                He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.</p>
                <p>In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. 
                I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". 
                A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. 
                But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. 
                It's also a personal statement about the band itself.</p>
