        Huey Lewis and the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco,
        California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early
        1990s, eventually achieving 19 top ten singles across the Billboard Hot
        100, Adult Contemporary, and Mainstream Rock charts.

        Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports
        came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially
        and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new
        sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big
        boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far
        more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

        In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I
        think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". A song so
        catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they
        should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the
        importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band
        itself. -Patrick Batemen
